### 🎬 **Editing / Transition Notes**

- **Hook:** Start with a cold open (Sudeep’s “Every club says they work…” line) before any text/logo.
    
- **Transitions:** Use _whip-pans, snap-zooms, and match cuts_ between the 3 members for flow.
    
- **Music:** Build-up style low beat start → energetic mid → emotional closing.
