### **MVC Model**

**M = Model | V = View | C = Controller**

---
### **Model (M)**

- Handles **data and database interactions**.
- Defines data formats and connects to DBs like **SQL, MongoDB, SQL Server**.
---

### **View (V)**

- Represents the **User Interface**.
- Built using technologies like **React, JS, Angular, Flutter**, etc.
- Displays data and sends user actions to the controller.
---
### **Controller (C)**

- Connects the **View and Model**.
- Receives input from the view, processes it, interacts with the model, and sends back responses.
---
### **How it Works**

- **View → Controller → Model → Controller → View**
- User interacts with **View**, which sends data to the **Controller**.
- Controller fetches/stores data via the **Model**, then updates the **View**.
