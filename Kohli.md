**Slide 2: The Puma Puzzle**
Example: ₹100Cr Puma deal (TOI reported).
Ads air in India → Sales in India → YOU pay GST.
But payment? Not to Virat Kohli directly.
It flows to a UK shell co. Why? No Indian tax on "foreign income."
🤔 Loophole or smart biz? 

**Slide 3: Enter Shell Companies**
Shell co: Empty corp, no real ops/assets. Perfect tax shield.
Holds IP, endorsements → Routes money offshore.
Virat as "ultimate beneficiary" = Profits stay low-tax.
Entrepreneur tip: Legit structuring, not evasion! Consult CA.
*Theory only.* 

**Slide 4: Real Example - MAGIK LAMP Ltd**
UK company \#14267506, incorp Aug 2022.
Directors: Veer Kohli, Mishesh A. Sharma, T.I. Cobham Kutte.
Beneficiaries? Mr. Kohli \& Anushka. Address: West Yorkshire, UK.
Indian ads → UK entity → Tax in UK (lower rates). Genius?
*Public records, theoretical use.* 

**Slide 5: DTAA Magic**
India-UK Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement.
Earn abroad? Credit in India, avoid double dip.
Kohli in UK? Income "sourced" there = Minimal India tax.
He STILL paid ₹66Cr on BCCI/IPL (domestic). Fair play!
Pro move for global hustlers. 

**Slide 6: Sachin’s Actor Hack**
God of Cricket → "Actor" to save ₹58L! 😂
Section 80RR: Tax breaks for actors/musicians on foreign earnings.
Cricketer by day, "actor" for ads. Deduction city.
Creative classification = Legal wins. 

**Slide 7: Entrepreneur Playbook**

1. Shell cos for IP/endorsements (UK/Dubai?).
2. DTAA nations for residency.
3. Biz classifications (actor? Influencer?).
4. Pay domestic tax (like Kohli's ₹66Cr).
*Always legal get expert advice. Not for everyone.
