Below is my explainations:
**It has an inbuilt Tomcat server.**  
**What is a Tomcat Server?**  
Apache Tomcat is an open-source servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It functions as a lightweight web server that is primarily used to run Java Servlets and render web pages that use Java Server Pages (JSP). In simpler terms, Tomcat receives requests from clients (like browsers), processes those requests using Java-based code (servlets/JSP), and sends back the appropriate response.

**Example:**  
Suppose you're building a Java-based web application like an online book store. When a user searches for a book, the request goes to the Tomcat server. Tomcat processes this request using a servlet (a Java class), fetches the result from the database, and returns an HTML page displaying the search results.
