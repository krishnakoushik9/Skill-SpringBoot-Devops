- Stack and Heap memory 
a = 10
a -> reference variable
10 -> object
- Stacks stores reference variables but actual object is stored in Heap Memory
- a -> Points location towards Heap Memory

- A doesn't store the actual object data it just stores the actual heap memory location and refers to that position
- More than 1 reference variables can be pointing to same object
- If any one of the reference variables changes the value of Object that will be effecting and visible to all the variables cause Original Value is changed
- Java only has Pass by Reference Value
