## **Part 1: The Gathering and the Lost Location**

### **What Happened**

The dream begins with you surrounded by your close friends **Saketh, Veeresh, Snehal, and Akshitha**. The location is unfamiliar, vast, and sacred in its structure something like a **temple or a mela**, glowing yet unsettling. The timeline feels fluid. You and your friends are simply enjoying, walking through the place, talking, and laughing. You eventually find a **canteen**, eat something together, and everything seems calm and normal.  
Then you decide to call **Potato**, the girl you like. To your surprise, she says she’s _also in that location._ That’s when your focus shifts from being present with your friends to a deep urge to _find her._

### **What It Represents**

This section represents **comfort before emotional chaos.** The temple-like or mela-like place shows a **mind-space of spiritual confusion** a mix of celebration and sacredness, signifying how your emotions (especially towards Potato) exist in both joy and anxiety.  
Your friends represent **balance and familiarity**, grounding forces in your life.  
But the moment Potato enters, the entire emotional gravity shifts symbolizing how **love or attachment changes your inner world completely.** The moment you start searching for her, it’s no longer your friends’ world it becomes _hers_. The “temple” becomes a **maze of emotional devotion**, and the “canteen” a symbol of nourishment marks the last moment of emotional stability.

## **Part 2: The Search through the Steel Building**

### **What Happened**

You leave your friends and enter a massive **steel-structured building**. From outside, it’s metallic and industrial cold and lifeless. But inside, it’s _gorgeous_, almost unreal. You climb four floors, endlessly searching for **Potato**, but she doesn’t tell you where she is. The search feels eternal.  
Suddenly, the walls start changing **pictures of strange animals** appear. One picture a **half-rotten, bleeding deer** begins to _speak._ It warns:

> “Careful, Koushik… you are letting things out of your control.”  
> You feel fear, but continue searching anyway.

### **What It Represents**

The steel building represents the **mind’s emotional architecture** rigid from outside but full of imagination and illusions inside. The “four endless floors” show your **layers of obsession or longing** how you climb emotionally higher but never find satisfaction.  
The **deer** is a potent symbol: it’s a creature of innocence, purity, and intuition. But here, it’s wounded and decaying a sign that your **innocence in love is dying**, and your subconscious is warning you. The deer’s words, “you are letting things of your control,” symbolize how your emotions are starting to dominate logic.  
You didn’t stop the search this shows how desire often overrides awareness, even after receiving a clear inner warning.

## **Part 3: The Woman in the White Saree**

### **What Happened**

Out of nowhere, an **old woman** appears dressed in a **white saree**, **smoky grey hair**, barely able to walk. You instinctively help her. She asks you to take her to the **ground mela**.  
While going down, you suddenly realize something off you have **descended 7 floors**, though the building only had **4 floors** when you entered. Despite this impossible detail, you exit into the mela again, as she requested.  
Then you see **Potato** walking with her **bag** toward her classmates, including **Kashyap**, the guy who likes her. He calls her to sit beside him. She goes, and you try to stop her taking her hand to sit near you instead.

### **What It Represents**

The **old woman** in white is a _manifestation of wisdom, guilt, or suppressed intuition._ She appears when your emotions peak representing the **part of your mind that still wants to guide you out of confusion.**  
Her difficulty in walking symbolizes your **struggling inner wisdom** the voice that still wants to lead you back to stability (the mela = the outer world).  
But the 7 floors reveal something powerful _you descended deeper into your subconscious than you realized._ The mind created **three hidden floors of pain** perhaps guilt, self-doubt, or loss between your rational self and your emotional self.  
Once outside, you face emotional reality **Potato choosing Kashyap**. This is where illusion meets truth. The dream places your deepest insecurity right before you _seeing her choose someone else while you stand helpless._

## **Part 4: Anger, Voices, and Emotional Collapse**

### **What Happened**

You leave in silence, returning to the canteen where your friends sit. **Snehal** asks you what happened, but you remain quiet. Inside, rage and sorrow twist together.  
Then **Sanay**, your old classmate, appears whispers to you:

> “You are just an idiot. The more you love, the more you’ll fall in your life and it’ll destroy you.”  
> Snehal notices, but is too tired to react. Meanwhile, **Potato** doesn’t call or text you for _two days_ in the mela. You try to find her again, but she avoids you choosing to stay beside Kashyap and his friend **Nandhini**. The emotional weight grows unbearable; it’s so intense that even in the dream, you feel it physically before waking up.

### **What It Represents**

This part captures **emotional collapse and reality confrontation.**  
The whisper by Sanay is not really his it’s your **inner critic**, the voice of hopelessness. It reflects your fear that love will always lead to pain, that vulnerability equals downfall.  
Snehal’s fatigue shows **emotional detachment** your logical side recognizing you can’t keep explaining your pain to others.  
Potato’s silence and avoidance signify **emotional distance** the moment when hope meets disillusionment.  
The canteen where you began joyfully becomes the **arena of heartbreak.** The circle closes painfully, mirroring how emotional loops in real life often end where they began but emptier.

## **Part 5: The Unspoken Warning (Prediction)**

### **What It Represents**

Every symbolic element the **rotting deer**, the **old woman**, the **7 hidden floors**, and **Sanay’s whisper** ties to one unified warning from your subconscious:

> “You are about to let love consume parts of yourself that hold your sanity, logic, and peace.”

If the deer’s warning was the first crack, the old woman’s presence was the last attempt of your subconscious to pull you back.  
The **7 floors** are a premonition that your pain will deepen beyond what’s visible. The **old woman’s descent** was not into the real mela, but into the darkest level of your inner mind, where heartbreak, helplessness, and obsession coexist.

If ignored, these symbols predict:

- Emotional numbness (losing sensitivity to your own worth).
    
- Anger turning into withdrawal or self-blame.
    
- A repeating pattern of loving too deeply without protecting your inner balance.
    

The dream’s _core sadness_ is not Potato leaving it’s **you forgetting yourself in pursuit of her presence.**  
The bleeding deer, the smoky woman, Sanay’s cruel whisper all are manifestations of your psyche screaming:

> “If you don’t let go, love will turn into loss and loss into your identity.”

### 🌙 **Final Takeaway**

This dream is not a story about a girl it’s a mirror of how your emotions spiral when love becomes unreciprocated devotion.  
Your mind built an entire mythic world temples, steel halls, bleeding deer, ghostly guides all just to show one truth:  
**When your heart searches too deeply for someone who won’t call back, your soul starts warning you through symbols.**
